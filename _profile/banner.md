## Who I am

A software/data/AI/ML consultant with a background in physics, education, and software engineering. As a queer professional, I believe that diverse, inclusive teams build better software systems and develop stronger, more sustainable ways of working together. I've led teams delivering [real-time optimization of steel manufacture](#smart-steel-technologies-gmbh), designed [software architecture for medical AI applications](#distributed-ai-laboratory-tu-berlin), and published research on [AI explainability and trustworthiness](#the-explainability-paradox-challenges-for-xai-in-digital-pathology) in medical decision-making.
